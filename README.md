# Minishell : *As beautiful as a shell*

>  The existence of shells is linked to the very existence of IT. At the time, all developers agreed that communicating with a computer using aligned 1/0 switches was seriously irritating. It was only logical that they came up with the idea of creating a software to communicate with a computer using interactive lines of commands in a language somewhat close to the human language.
Yes, you guessed it. This project is about creating a simple shell. Yes, my own little bash.

I was able to travel through time and encounter problems my computer science ancestors encountered when *Windows* didn't even exist. 
If there was a cute summary of this program, It would be that it needs to display a **prompt** when waiting for a new command line, have a working **history** of course, parse and execute the command, or in the case of an error : return the right error code and error message to the user.

The use of a **global variable** was only allowed for handling **signals**, and of course handling this part of the project should not access to the main data structures.

This project was a pretty heavy one but a turning point in the 42 Common Core, the skills obtained through mastering pipes, signals, parsing, execution and implementing some builtins ourselves such as **cd**, **echo**, **unset**, **export**, **env**, **pwd** and **exit**, were just astonishing.

Minishell is for sure one of the hardest projects of a Common Core student but one of the most satisfying and fulfilling ones.
